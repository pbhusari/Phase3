## Tasks

### Task 1

Start with a single table query with 3 attributes and one filter in the WHERE clause.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 2

In a single table query, filter between two dates. Include appropriate attributes (including the date attribute used in the filter) that would make the query useful.


#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 3

Use LIKE in a filter (with the % wildcard). Use LIKE in such a way that the filter cannot be accomplished with an equal sign. For example: where color like ‘b%’ to find all colors that start with b.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 4

In the select clause, calculate two attributes to make a temporary calculated column. Give it a column alias. For example: Select price, quantity, price * quantity AS TOTAL_PRICE.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 5

Use NOT IN to filter out a list of values from an attribute in a single table query.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 6

In the Select clause, use a Null Value function (NVL) on an attribute, and right justify another of your attributes in the same statement. Add * to fill the empty spaces in the right justified column, and choose an appropriate replacement for the null values.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 7

In your database, where you have a date stored (order date, event date, etc), find the oldestdate along with the other fields in that table. (ie, oldest order in the ORDER table, oldest event stored in the DB).

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 8

Use the Count function to group by an attribute in your database. Use Count appropriately, as there should not be a count of 1 in each row of the result set. Find an attribute that uses the same value more than once (ie, do not use count on a primary key…).

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 9

Use the Sum function to add up a calculated column. For example: SUM(price*quantity) as TOTAL_ORDER.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 10

Use the Average function on either a number or date in your database. Use Group by to group the average by one field in the result set. (ie, Average price of each equipment type)

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 11

Use HAVING to filter an aggregated function (use Count, Sum, Min, Max or Avg in a query)

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 12

Build a SQL statement that filters with both a WHERE clause and a HAVING clause.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 13

Build an INNER JOIN between just two tables. The chosen attributes in the Select clause should come from both tables. Filter with at least two items in the WHERE clause.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 14

Build a query that has to pull from at least 4 different tables. The attributes in the Select clause should come from at least two of the tables. Include a date as one of your attributes and set the date format to report out like: Saturday, November 24, 2018.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 15

Use a nested subquery to find a pool of data and then the outer query is looking for records NOT IN the nested query.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 16

Use a subquery to find results that are greater than an average result in your nested query.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 17

Build an INNER JOIN between two tables and include an aggregate function in the Select clause. Must also include the use of Group By.

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 18

Build a query that utilizes a LEFT OUTER JOIN. The result set should have parents that do not have children. (If you do not have this situation in your database, do an additional INSERT in the parent table in order to make the task work)

#### Assigned to



#### SQL Statment

```SQL

```

#### Results

(Note: Import sql --> csv --> markdown for pretty tables)
```

```

### Task 19

Build a query that utilizes a RIGHT OUTER JOIN. The result set should have children that do not have parents. (If you do not have this situation in your database, alter your database to allow a child table to have NULL values in the foreign key field. Then do an additional INSERT in the child table in order to make the task work).
